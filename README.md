# RAW DOG NUMPY

A repository dedicated to actually learning how to use Numpy instead of trying to focus on a boring professor with a confusing accent to only learn enough Numpy to get an A on their final exam with R and Julia included. Approaching the material by learning from the raw source, [the official numpy *2.2* documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/).

I used the same methodology to learn a good amount of Java/Swing, Python, Swift, etc.

## [Installation](https://numpy.org/install/)

I recommend that you install [*anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/download) beforehand to get access to the **conda**-forge package manager system to enhance your data science/scientific computing experience and be part of a community driven package maintenance/distribution channel.  

### Verify Your Installation

Open your IDE, Terminal, Code Editor and run

```
import numpy as np
print(np.__version__) 
```
