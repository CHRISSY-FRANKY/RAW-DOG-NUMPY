# RAW DOG NUMPY

A repository dedicated to actually learning how to use Numpy instead of trying to focus on a boring professor with a confusing accent to only learn enough Numpy to get an A on their final exam with R and Julia included. Approaching the material by learning from the raw source, [the official numpy *2.2* documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/).

I used the same methodology to learn a good amount of Java/Swing, Python, Swift, etc.
